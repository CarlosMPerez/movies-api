// Register application-layer services into the DI container.
// 
// This approach promotes a clean separation of concerns by isolating service registration logic 
// within the application layer itself, rather than cluttering the startup configuration with details.
// 
// The use of an extension method (AddApplicationLayer) encapsulates which services the application 
// layer needs, allowing the Program.cs file to remain focused on composition rather than implementation details.
//
// Dependency Injection (DI) is used to manage the lifetimes and dependencies of services. In this case,
// AddSingleton is used for IMovieRepository, meaning the same instance will be reused throughout the 
// application's lifetimeâ€”ideal for stateless services or those that manage internal state safely.
//
// This setup also improves testability, maintainability, and scalability by decoupling infrastructure concerns 
// from core business logic. Each layer is responsible for registering only its own dependencies.
